        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. </p>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>
        <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>
        <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <p>The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.Elasticsearch is a full-text search and analytics engine, while Logstash is a log aggregator that collects and processes data from multiple sources, converts, and ships it to various destinations, such as Elasticsearch. </p>
        <p>It enables users to take data from any source, in any format, and search, analyze, and visualize it in real-time.</p>
        <p>The ELK Stack was formerly known as the ELK Stack for the core products in the group, but has been rebranded as the Elastic Stack.</p>
        <p>AWS offers various ingestion tools to support the ELK Stack</p>
